= Tests

This directory contains the tests implemented to prove that Queensland Spatial Information (QSI)'s https://linked.data.gov.au/def/addr[_Address Model_] meets the design requirements set for it.

The tests are itemised below and the content for them is stored in folders within this folder named after the test ID.
